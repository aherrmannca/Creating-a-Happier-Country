# Creating-a-Happier-Country
Data science project aimed at determining what factors are most important
for a country to work on, and in what order, with the main goal to improve
happiness.

Purpose:
Happiness is the only quality of our lives which ultimately matters. It's
how we passively quantify all the factors we deem important in living a good
life, i.e. it's the overall appreciation of one's life as a whole. Would one
rather be rich and powerful yet unhappy or neither rich nor powerful yet
happy? Money does bring some happiness, but there is an extent.

A Government is a non profit organization that is to the people, for the
people, by the people. It aims to work for the people and their betterment
as a whole. Thus, one of the best values to judge a country's success is by
how happy their citizens are.

# Creating-a-Happier-Country
Data science project aimed at determining what factors are most important
for a country to work on, and in what order, with the main goal to improve
happiness.

Purpose:
Happiness matters. It's how we quantify the essentials necessary for appreciating our quality of life. Everyone has heard and probably pondered this question: Would you rather be rich or happy? There is no simple answer.

A Government is an entity that aims to work for its people and their advancement as a whole; and thus its success, its country's success, can be measured by how happy their citizens are.
